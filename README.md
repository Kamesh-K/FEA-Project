# Truss Optimization using Genetic Algorithms
## Objective 
The project focuses on using Genetic Algorithms for optimizing truss members.
## Methodology 
Size Optimization is carried in this particular. Code for the FEA based solver is generic and hence can be extended to any truss and the optimization can be carried out. 
## Results
A 50% decrease in the weight was achieved and benchmarked with other methods available. Please go through the documents attached for further understanding of the project.
